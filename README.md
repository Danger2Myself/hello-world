Just another repository

Howdy!  I'm a telecom guy by trade after cutting my teeth in the Air Force.  I am a complete novice at programming.  This has been created as part of my get started/learn how to use GitHub tutorial process.  I wish I would have more inspired to learn programming at a much younger age and it seems a little overwhelming now... maybe an old dog can learn new skills?
